# Automatic-Speech-Recognition

Done by Cindy Pereira and Justine Diliberto

Application and analysis of automatic digit recognition systems to explore the impact of:
- the language model used
- the speaker groups (gender, age)
- the length of the digit sequence 
- the noise level

Run `code/main.py` from the main folder.

All the code can be found in the "code" folder. 
"output" folder contains the output automatically produced by the decoders.
"ps_data" is the data for the decoders (grammars, dictionaries, language model, data for language model).
"results" contains the results (sorted by exercise), for each language model, length, SNR, speaker group. It also contains the hypotheses and references.
There are 4 folders containing the provided audio data ("SNR05dB", "SNR15dB", "SNR25dB", "SNR35dB").
